# Debugging with Visual Studio Code

The Getting Started Guides are fully compatible with development within Visual Studio Code. There are currently three different development experiences to choose from.

| Experience | Description |
|-|-|
| [Local](debugging-local.md) | Install the build tools locally on your machine and debug directly with VS Code | 
| [Container](debugging-container.md) | Building in a local container allows you to deploy the development environment with a couple of clicks, bypassing the need to manually install the required build tools. It does, however, require the installation of Docker and Windows Subsystem for Linux, as well as having Virtualization enabled in the BIOS.|
| [Codespaces](debugging-codespaces.md) | Sets up a cloud-hosted container and a customizable VS Code environment directory from a GitHub repository. Device drivers and a local GDB Server instance are still required on your local machine. |
